# To do list for the SKY BASS BOT

## From Poly:
I don't want the bot to be spam, but I want people to set it to their own wishes and just give some recomended settings out of the box. Really wanna think this through instread of being just a boring old shoutout bot, bc the Click Through Rate (CTR) on that is terrible.
